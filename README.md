# Hot Module Reloading for Extensions
Hot is a hot module reloading extension that I use for development. It is used
to automatically reload files once changes have been made, and is inspired by
development servers in the web development scene, specifically Webpack and Vite.

I do not recommend anybody use this, it is strictly here as a finished project
and as a potential model for me and future ideas. The actual concept that this
builds upon, while great for DX, can cause adverse effects due to applying hacks
to work - even as the author, I am using this with sheer discretion. Do not
expect help with this, do not use it, it is highly unrecommended and potentially
unstable - **it will not be given.**

Thank you.
